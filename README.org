** Summary

This package provides commands to quickly add ~eslint-disable~, ~eslint-disable-line~ and
~eslint-disable-next-line~ comments to your JavaScript files.

For example, if the current line has an [[https://eslint.org/][eslint]] error such as in this screenshot:

[[file:media/flymake-error.png]]

Then typing ~M-x eslint-disable-rule-disable-next-line~ will add a
~eslint-disable-next-line~ comment on the previous line to disable the
eslint rule:

[[file:media/disable-next-line.png]]

If you configure ~eslint-disable-rule-all-executable~ and add
~eslint-disable-rule-all~ to ~eslint-disable-rule-find-rules-hook~
(see below for details) you will get a list of all active eslint rules
for the current file. This makes it easy to disable any rule:

[[file:media/all-rules.png]]

** Usage

If you use flymake (provided by Emacs) or [[https://www.flycheck.org/][flycheck]], you can just type
~M-x eslint-disable-rule-next-line~ to disable the rule that causes you
a problem at point.

If you use neither flymake nor flycheck, you can still use ~M-x
eslint-disable-rule-next-line~ but you have to configure
~eslint-disable-rule-find-rules-hook~ first and maybe
~eslint-disable-rule-all-executable~ as well (see below).

** Configuration
*** ~eslint-disable-rule-find-rules-hook~

List of functions that will all be executed to get a list of all
eslint rule names the user might want to disable.  Feel free to add
~eslint-disable-rule-all~ to this list once you have configured
~eslint-disable-rule-all-executable~.

*** ~eslint-disable-rule-all-executable~

Change this variable to reference the "eslint" executable you want to
run to get the list of all rules. Because I use [[https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js][eslint_d]], this
variable has value ~"eslint_d"~ for me.
